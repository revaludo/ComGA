This is the PyTorch implementation for "A Community Aware Graph Augmentation Method for Graph-Based Recommendation".

This project is based on [SGL](https://github.com/wujcan/SGL-Torch). Thanks to the contributors.

Firstly, run [maindis.py] to discover community affiliations and relationships.

Then, run [mainrec.py] to perform community aware graph augmentation for recommendation.
